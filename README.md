# Knowledge Manager
Knowledge manager, alias KnoMa, is (not) just another note-taking application.
Most note-taking application focus on the act of note-taking itself.
They allow users to paste text, files, images, videos, and other multimedia. 
For every note, users can assign custom tags or provide metadata.
While KnoMa can handle some of this functionality, there are for sure other applications that can do this better. 

Yet, this is only part of the story.
The often overlooked part is reading notes or gaining value from the notes. 
Many users never read most of the notes they have created. 
There is value in note-taking itself; however, we should want more from our notes. 
Users should be able to see their notes in context, connect them, and create networks.

While not implemented, this was, and still is, the motivation to create KnoMa.
