# Use-cases
This document describes use-cases that motivates KnoMa functionality.

## Research
In this case KnoMa is used to store references/links. The use browser the 
internet and search for relevant sources for particular topic. They store
the resources, mostly URLs, in the document as notes. Each note can have
a short description and annotations assigned to it.

Later on, the user can decide to expand the notes into documents, by creating 
new documents and linking them to the notes. This allows to create a hierarchy 
of documents.

## Video notes
When watching YouTube video, or any other, the application should allow 
user to take notes, and pictures of the video. There should be option
to add time stamp for the video into the notes detail.
